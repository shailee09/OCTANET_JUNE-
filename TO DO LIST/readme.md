## To-Do List App with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

### Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- A code editor of your choice.

### Step 1: Set Up Your Project
1. Create a new folder for your project (you can name it whatever you like).
2. Inside the project folder, create three files:
   - `index.html`: The main HTML file.
   - `style.css`: The CSS file for styling.
   - `script.js`: The JavaScript file for functionality.

### Step 2: Build the Basic HTML Structure
In your `index.html` file, add the following HTML structure:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>To-Do Application</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Inside the container, add an input field for adding tasks, a list to display the tasks, and buttons for adding and removing tasks. -->
    <div class="container">
        <!-- Your HTML content here -->
    </div>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

### Step 3: Add Functionality with JavaScript
In your `script.js` file, implement the following functionalities:
- Read data from the list.
- Add tasks.
- Mark tasks as completed.
- Edit existing tasks.
- Remove tasks from the list.

### Step 4: Style Your App
In your `style.css` file, apply styles to make your app visually appealing. Customize colors, fonts, layout, and other design elements.

### Step 5: Test Your App
Open your `index.html` file in a web browser to test your to-do list app. Add tasks, remove them, and clear the list to ensure everything works as expected. You can further enhance your app by adding features like task prioritization, due dates, or data persistence with local storage.


### Step 6: DEMO
